## How to compile microsoft paint from windows XP src leak.

In this README file I'm going to explain how to compile and modify the paint program from windows XP. The leak is in this repo:
https://github.com/cryptoAlgorithm/nt5src/. 

Ok, first of all we want to locate the SRC folder. Is in ```NT\shell\osshell\accesory```.
Now we want to run the command to prepare the compiler. We will run ```NT\shell\tools\razzle.cmd free offline```
